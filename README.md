# Google-Books-Refactor
Refactoring a book searching website from using a RESTful API to a GraphQL API.

## Description
In this project I was provided with a fully functioning app that connects to the google books api and allows users to create a profile where they can search for books and add them to a list on their profile.  The provided project used MongoDB and a RESTful API.  My job was to refactor this code to utilize a graphQL API instead of REST.  This involved replacing the routes with TypeDefs and Resolver files as well as changing the API calls on the frontend with Queries and Mutations.  The app was then deployed on heroku using MongoDB Atlas

## User Story

```md

I WANT to search for new books to read
SO THAT I can keep a list of books to purchase
```
